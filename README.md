# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. You'll need some stuff to get everything working properly.

For the i3 setup, listed from most to least important (sort of)
* linux
* x11-utils
* i3
* rofi (dmenu replacement)
* lightdm and light-locker
* feh (for background)
* polybar (for top bar)
* notify-osd
* Terminess Powerline
* San Fransico Text (font)
* Unifont (font)
* Siji text (stark/siji, font)
* light (haikarainen/light, a backlight tool)
* urxvt
* systemd (for dockmodeon script, see `.bash_profile`)
Probably forgot a bunch of stuff. Just install whatever you need

Features:
* Dual battery support on top bar
* Auto-locking on lid close
* Quick and easy second monitor support with `dockmodeon` and `dockmodeoff`
* Mostly standard i3 binds with a few extras
* TTY recoloring
* Colorful welcome message on login :)
* Backlight and volume key support
* Looks good and soft on the eyes, gruvbox-like colorscheme
